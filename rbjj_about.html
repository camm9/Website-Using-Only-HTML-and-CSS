                        Resenha was started in 2021 by Marcio and Catherine. They wanted to create an online resource
                        for Jiu Jitsu that would cover topics and knowledge that weren't widely talked about and had 
                        only been shared by word of mouth previously. The goal of Resenha is to share all Jiu Jitsu knowledge freely and
                        to make Jiu Jitsu one of the most popular sports in the world.
